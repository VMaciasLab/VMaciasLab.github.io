 Mosquito-borne pathogens continue to be a major problem for both humans and animals. In many cases, pathogens are not simply physically moved from one vertebrate host to another. Instead, they often undergo complex development within the mosquito, both in the sense that they infect and traverse different tissues, and in the sense that they pass through multiple different developmental stages.

### Mosquitoes as Ecosystems
Something catchy about the complexity of genetic interactions in mosquitoes (encountering, phages, viruses, bacteria, parasites). Within this ecosystem, members interact and recognize each other in a variety of ways. By understanding this context we
