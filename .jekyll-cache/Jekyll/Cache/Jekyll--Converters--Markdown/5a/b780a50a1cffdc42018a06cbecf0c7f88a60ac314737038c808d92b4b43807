<p>We are a brand-new lab in the Department of Biological Sciences at <a href="http://www.unt.edu">The University of North Texas</a>!</p>

<p>Weâ€™re gearing up to explore the molecular environment of our favorite disease vector, the mosquito. Mosquitoes use RNA interference (RNAi) for a whole host of functionalities, but we havenâ€™t yet appreciated its scope and this situation is proving to be much more complex than in some of the closer model systems. Our work seeks to untangle, understand and describe the roles of RNA interference pathways in processes relevant to disease transmission and disease control.</p>

<p>Leveraging molecular-genetic and transgenic techniques, some of which we are building ourselves, we will ask questions about the basic biology of small RNAs. Ultimately, we can use this knowledge to innovate approaches to dealing with both ancient and emerging mosquito borne-diseases..</p>

<p><strong>We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team</strong> <a href="http://localhost:4000/vacancies">(more info)</a> <strong>!</strong></p>
