      <p>Mosquito-borne pathogens continue to be a major problem for both humans and animals. In many cases, pathogens are not simply physically moved from one vertebrate host to another. Instead, they often undergo complex development within the mosquito, both in the sense that they infect and traverse different tissues, and in the sense that they pass through multiple different developmental stages.</p>

      <p>The current genetic model systems are limited in their ability to enlighten the function of all the interesting and special biology mosquitoes use to find hosts, process blood meals, and engage with pathogens and symbionts in the human blood. For blood feeders, Mosquitoes are at the front edge of genetic research. Our lab will join in the effort to establish new and powerful techniques to explore biology that has yet been challenging to get our minds (and our experiments) around!</p>
